#----A few notes about using EE within Cloud sites
-Do not use memcache, it will not work as customers do not have access to the CS memcache
-Setup minimee for minifying js and css more efficiently: http://johndwells.com/software/minimee
-Don't use a persistent DB connection as this will stack your queries and you'll run out of connections


#------use Template caching
In the admin panel:
Design -> Templates -> Template Preferences
Select all the templates that need to be cached
Change "Enable Caching" to Yes
Set a reasonable refresh interval (this is in minutes, so 60 for an hour, 1440 for a day, etc)
Click update


#------Use a non-persistent Database Connection
Admin -> System Administration -> Database Settings
Persistent Database Connection set to "No"

#------Use ImageMagick for Image resizing---If desired
Admin -> System Administration -> Image Resizing Preferences
Change "Image Resizing Protocol" to ImageMagick

#------Disable dynamic Channel Queries
Admin -> Channel Administration -> Global Preferences
Set Cache Dynamic Channel Queries to "No"
